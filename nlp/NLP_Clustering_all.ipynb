Then she was extremely rude telling me that my food wouldn't be ready for a while, in a super condescending tone. I asked her if I could at least get my drink that she failed to give me at the time of my transaction and she went off and did other things, then put the drink on the counter, not even bothering to get my attention. Long story short, rude service and TERRIBLE, OVERPRICED FOOD (McDonalds has better burgers, for HALF the price. AND their \"world famous chili fries\" were atrocious). I will NEVER eat here again.

      "    My husband and I were driving by Tivoli when we saw a sign for this place, so I pulled it up on Yelp and realized it was their grand opening. Looked at the menu and my husband did a U turn so we could check it out. We were seated right away with out a reservation, which was great. We got there before the dinner rush. The place is very welcoming, and the staff was very friendly. I loved the desk with the collection of vintage salt and pepper shakers. Would of been cool to see something like that on the tables instead of plain plastic ones. I was really excited to try the Chicken and dumpling soup, but the waitress informed me they were out, bummer. Running out of an item on your first night open? Interesting. Luckily there were plenty of yummy sounding items to try. We ordered the baked BBQ 1/2 chicken, Maple n Bacon Baked Beans, Homemade cornbread, and the baked cheddar mac n cheese. While we were waiting, the lights dimmed down, and started flickering, annoyingly. The staff seemed to notice, but nothing was done, or could be done to remedy this. They have their biscuits to order on the menu, but FYI they bring you a basket of them before you get your food. We found a hair on a biscuit, which happens, but not off to a great start so far. We weren't a huge fan of these. Kind of hard, and not very warm at all.  I did notice they looked like they were in a heart shape, which if so, I loved! Our corn bread came out way before the rest of our food, and it was in a skillet, but completely cold. Would of preferred it warm and served with the rest of our meal. The chicken was so delicious! Juicy and soft, and just so good. It would of been nice to have a small dish of BBQ sauce to dip it in, but this was by far the best thing we ordered. The baked beans had slices of sausage in it, which was a welcoming surprise. I give the beans a thumbs up along with the chicken. The mac n cheese was way too rich for both of us, but that is just our taste. Some people might really be into that. All the sides were served in miniature stoneware, which were adorable. In the end we weren't super impressed with the food, but we will be back to try the soup and banana pudding for sure!\n",

The restaurant has both inside and outside dining options. This is a big deal to me because I am someone who likes to sit outside and enjoy the nice Las Vegas weather when the extreme heat decides to give us a break. All of the staff is super friendly and great at remembering returning faces! Sometimes you can even catch the owners Dalton and Bryce in their visiting with customers!\n",

BUT have no fear, it's always a short wait and totally worth the mouth watering tease as you watch plates of Jamaican and New Mexican style food pass you by! Every meal I have had at DW Bistro has been an explosion of flavors and spices complimenting some of my favorite dishes. When it comes to breakfast I am a huge eggs benedict fan. When I saw that DW Bistro had eggs benedict on their menu I was very excited to try this. I asked if they could add some of their New Mexican style slow cooked pork that is simmered in New Mexican red chili on top of it and they gladly had no problem. It ended up being the best decision I have ever made. The mix of the red chili, tender pulled pork and hollandaise sauce made for one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. REMEMBER - The eggs benedict is on their menu but you have to ask for the New Mexican style slow cooked pork to be added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch is always something I have a hard time with as I am never really too hungry at lunch and seem to never be able to make up my mind on what I want. I decided to try their chicken flautas since they sounded so good and seemed like a small enough dish that I wouldn't leave feeling overly stuffed. When they brought me the dish I was very impressed! First, you could tell they put a lot of thought into the presentation which of course made for an awesome food porn Kodak moment! Second, the taste was out of this world. They drizzle fresh lime infused sour cream on top which taste delicious and add avocado tomatillo on top. I was very impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to dinner DW Bistro will never let you down. From the Chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta to the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork, each meal is sure to pack flavor that will blow you out of this world. I went with the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork simmered in NM red chile. The bowl is served with over-easy eggs and rice with a fresh flour tortilla. The meal is a little large and I never finish it. There is so much flavor in the pork and the red chili that I didn't want to stop eating it.\n",

They did however notice and get me a free drink and I didn't even say anything.  +1 point for being aware and preemptive.  They do give some bread service with assorted pretzels and butter and horseradish cheese that rivals the Culinary Dropouts pretzel appetizers.  And it's just the bread!  The food was worth the wait.  The potato puree was so rich and delicious.  The chicken was perfect.  The drink menu is on an iPad and the four that I tried were all spot on.  Enjoy!\n",

      "    OK fish and pasta at really high prices.  I started with the langoustines which tasted like a charcoal grill and were a bit chewy.  Then I had the warm cheese custard with mushrooms which I found odd and not very flavorful.  I tasted a pasta with the $90 extra truffles on them was disappointing. I've had good truffles, and these lacked flavor entirely.  The fish we had was good, cooked well, and served with a nice olive tomato sauce.  Our service was poor; the waiter brushed me off when I ordered a second drink, saying he'd be back, and he never returned, so we had to flag him down a second time.  We skipped dessert because the meal took so long.  Overall, I was really disappointed with the food.\n",

The sizzling bistek was one of the things we ordered.  The beef was literally immersed in so much oil, making the dish completely inedible. The waitress was so aloof and didn't even notice that we were dissatisfied when we told her not to box up this dish.  What's worse is that they declined to remove this item from our bill, considering this our fifth or sixth visit to this place.\n",

Xavier the manager also brought the tomato and watermelon salad as a palate cleanser between the portobello fries appetizer and the main course and it was quite tasty. We also sampled a new Prosecco that they added to the menu that I will definitely order the next time I dine. Israel the server provided excellent service and is extremely knowledgeable about the menu. \n",

      "    The Skinny: skillful executed dishes but really odd flavour combinations that do not work (3), service: was good and efficient for a place of this caliber (3.5) value: I think tapas might be a synonym for charging you more for a smaller dish of food - we ordered 6 dishes and 1 dessert for $75 prior to tax and tip(3) \n",

      "I really wanted to try Jaleo ever since I learned that Jose Andres started the whole tapas craze here in the US (although I first learned about tapas from watching the Frugal Gourmet when I was a kid - that's before all the sketchy allegations!). Plus being a Top Chef fan, I am always keen to try some of the guest judges cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I want to preface this. I do not doubt that Mr. Andres has incredible skill. I think that some of the things we had took a lot of technique to perfect (ie, Iberico ham croquettes and Cod empanadas). But technical skill does not make a great meal because in the end (for me)...it is all about flavour.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we started off with some roasted peppers, eggplant and sweet onion which was not what we were expecting. If you check out the pics - the eggplant looked like tapeworms swimming in olive oil. Visual appeal rates a zero. Luckily, it tasted okay albeit pedestrian given the caliber of this establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the thing that makes this place shine is their ability to take make fried food with a molten center. Both the Iberico ham croquettes and cod empanadas were surprisingly lovely and crisp on the outside without succuming to the liquid in the middle. There were problems with the these dishes though. The flavour of the Iberico ham was lost in the enveloping bechamel sauce. The cod empanadas were good but were overly fishy for my hubby's tastes (kind of like a strong mackeral - I'll admit, I did enjoy this but would likely not order this again).\n",
      "\n",
      "Iberico ham (oh, that creamy nutty luscious goodness that literally melts in your mouth) was very small portion considering the cost. Doesn't come with bread either which made it difficult to truly enjoy due to the inherent salinity of the meat. It definitely needed something else to justify the cost of this dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foie gras cannelloni was a huge disappointment mostly because of the preparation of the foie gras filling. The texture was grainy while the flavour of goose liver was completely absent from the dish. As a matter of fact, the filling had an unpleasant sourness to it that even overwhelmed the lovely unctiousness of the liberally combined shaved truffle and truffle oil. As they say, no bueno.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far the best dish of the night - the veal cheek with morel mushrooms. Utterly delicious, the judicious scent of cinnamon gave a mild hint of spice in this earthy dish. The textures of the meat was marvelous - like the best succulent short rib you've ever had. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hazelnut cake was surprising lacking in hazelnuts other than as a candied garnish. For a Nutella lover like me, it's like a bait and switch and I was oh-so-sad. A chocolate mousse over sponge was okay but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere for significantly less. Toying with my affections that way is a cruel joke, my friends. A cruel joke indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all tapas places, the portion sizes were small and definitely overpriced. I would probably go back again for the veal cheek alone (yes, it is that good and is also the sole reason this place rates a 3) but would likely order other things off the menu.\n",

      "This restaurant primarily focuses on my favorite food: burgers. Hopefully with a name like \"Gordon Ramsay's BurGR\" one would not be mislead or confused. And for obvious observation number 2 in this review: yes, the GR in \"BurGR\" stands for Gordon Ramsay. This joint is located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. You'll see a line of people waiting to be seated but temporarily ignore that and talk to the employees situated at the check in podium. Depending upon things, you may or may not have to wait in that line. We checked in w/ a party of three and were told it was about an hour wait. Well, we were in Vegas in a hotel/casino so there was plenty to do while we waited. \n",
      "\n",
      "After about an hour we were notified our table was ready and were lead inside and promptly seated. The first thing that caught my attention at the table were their nifty looking menus. When it came time to order I knew I had to try one of their shakes I had heard so much about. I decided upon the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Shake #4 which was an Oreo shake w/ creme brûlée pudding and topped w/ an Oreo cookie. Currently, this was and still is the best shake I have ever had. I think a lot had to do w/ the addition of that creme brûlée pudding, but omg that was delicious! I wanted to order another! However, they are pricey for a shake; not only was it the best, it was also the most expensive shake I have ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burger came and it was juicy and satisfying. None of the ingredients were too overpowering and it was not too hot or spicy given the name \"Hell's Kitchen\" (and yes, I'm aware that's the name of one of GR's restaurants/reality tv shows). The burger itself was cooked properly but was a tad smaller than what I was hoping for, but that's ok. Oh yes, we also ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries to share because I had also heard wonderful things about them and they did not disappoint either. Great flavor and the fries were more crispy rather than soggy which I liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server asked if we wanted dessert (which any server will do) to which I was going to decline until he mentioned their Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops. I was so intrigued and wanted to live it up during this particular visit that I went all YOLO and ordered the mofos. They come in a set of two and look effing adorable. It was the same exact concept of those push up pops you might remember having when you were a kid, but these had an air of elegance about them. I can't say I'm a fan of sticky toffee pudding, but I will admit that these were not bad at all. I still preferred that shake though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a blast during my visit here and can't wait for a return visit some day. I am interested in trying another one of their burgers and perhaps a different shake. Maybe I'll just get two next time.... Not because of the name but because of their offerings and my experience, I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay's BurGR.\n",
